# EmployeeManagementSystem
For this assignment, I was tasked to create an Employee Management System. I used Inquirer to help the user navigate the interface. The user is able to view and make changes to tables that contain data on employees.

The github repository is [here](https://github.com/JoseBurgos1993/EmployeeManagementSystem). Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HsJJONhRJB9IKVXhTAAhW6rQpJO1btzw/view) that demostrates the application in action.

## Usage
Run the employee_db.sql file to create the database and tables. You may then populate it with some default values from seed.sql or just start the application right away. When using the application, you may add new employees, roles or departments. You may also update the role of a particular employee. Everything is done through inquirer, so you can navigate menus with the arrow keys, and occationally have to input data.
